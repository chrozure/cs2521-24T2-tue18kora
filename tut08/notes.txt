Welcome to week 8, we are approaching the final stretch!

This week is the last week on graphs. We will be doing
some more graph traversals, Dijkstra's Algorithm
and then look at Minimum Spanning Trees.

I will also try to give a bwoof introduction to assignment 2.

Admin:
    - As always, there is handmarking to be done for
        labs 5, 7, and 8
    - The automarking for assignment 1 is now complete.
        You can check your marks using give. If you failed some autotest
        which you think you shouldn't have, please create a private
        post on the forum raising your concern.

        Jasper and I will get started on style marking soon, and
        next week I will give some general feedback about style.
