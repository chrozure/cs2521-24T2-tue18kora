Congrats on finishing aasignment 1!
Hope you all had a good flexi week :)

We briefly introduced graphs in week 5.
This week we will be looking at some graph traversals and problems.

The depth-first search algorithm is arguably one of the most important
algorithms in all of computer science, and both this week's lab and
assignment 2 will involve a lot of graph traversals.

Admin:
    - You can get handmarking done for lab04, lab05 and lab07 (fully handmarked)
    - Assignment 2 will be released this week, and the lecture on
        Thursday should give a brief introduction to it.
