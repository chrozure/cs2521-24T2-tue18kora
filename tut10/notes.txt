COMP2521 is almost over :(

This week's tutorial content is on the last few data structures heaps and tries,
but there are a lot of other important things to mention.


Admin:
    - Assignment 1 marking is finished and your marks should be out.
        Please let me know if you have any questions about it.

    - Assignment 2 is due this Friday at 8pm, good luck :)

    - The sample exam has been released, you can see it on webCMS
        - https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521/24T2/sample-exam

    - The lab today will be used for revision, any final handmarking,
        and also the exam demo.

    - MyExperience is out! Please do it! You get some cool perks if you do.


MyExperience:
    - At 50% response rate, and every 5% after:
        We will reveal the topic and mark value of a randomly chosen exam question
        Topic/mark value of one questions revealed at 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%e, ...

    - I have some snacks this week, which I will pass out to people who complete it





Final exam:
    - In the lab today, you have the opportunity to do
        do an exam demo, where you experience the exam environment.

    - Who wants to do it?



Heaps:
    - Heaps are an efficient tree-like data structure used to implement priority queues

    - You would have seen priority queues before with Dijkstra's algorithm
        or Prim's algorithm. They are like queues, except when you dequeue,
        it returns the number with the most priority, instead of the first value.

    - In this tutorial, we will be looking at max heaps. They have 2 properties:
        - Heap property:
            - The value at every node is larger than the value of all its children

        - Completeness property:
            - Every row is filled going from left to right.

Final words:
    - Thank you everyone for the great term! This term has been very fun to teach :)

    - Good luck with the exam, and I wish you all the best in the future!
