Under what circumstances would inserting a new word into a trie
not result in adding any new nodes? What would be the effect
on the tree of inserting the word?

If the new word is a prefix of an existing word in the trie, then
it won't require a new node to be added. The node representing the last character
in the word will simply be turned into a finishing (red) node.
