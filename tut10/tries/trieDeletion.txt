What are the two cases when deleting aword from a trie?
How is each case handled?

1. The word ends at an internal node

The finishing (red) node is simply changed into a non-finishing (black) node

2. The word ends at a leaf node

The finishing (red) node is unlinked from its parent and removed (freed).
If the parent of that node is a non-finishing leaf node, it is also removed from the tree.
Repeat until we reach a finishing node or a non-leaf node.
