a. A simple way to solve this problem is to sort the array in increasing order,
and then the largest k elements would be the last k elements of the sorted array.
What is the worst-case time complexity of this approach?

The worst-case time complexity is dominated by the cost of sorting the array.
Assuming we are using merge sort/heap sort, this is O(n log n).



b. Come up with a more efficient method that uses a heap.
What is the worst-case time complexity of this method?

We can use a min heap and start deleting as soon as it contains more than k elements.
In this way, the heap will contain the largest k elements we have seen so far.
The worst case time complextiy for this approach is O(n log k).
